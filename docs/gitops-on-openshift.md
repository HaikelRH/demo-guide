### GitOps on OpenShift

GitOps is a form of "Operations by Pull Request" coined by Weaveworks in 2017. GitOps enables maintaining workloads on OpenShift utilizing Git as the sole source of truth and automation so that engineers and maintainers can operate clusters more safely and securely at scale. Instead of using `oc` or `kubectl` all changes are pushed through Git. The Git repository will contain a declarative description of the infrastructure and its desired state.

### Self-Paced Learning

* [OpenShift: Interactive Learning Portal — GitOps Introduction with OpenShift](https://learn.openshift.com/introduction/gitops-introduction/): This course will guide you through the deployment of a simple application using GitOps Principles and Patterns on OpenShift.
* [OpenShift: Interactive Learning Portal — Multi-cluster GitOps with OpenShift](https://learn.openshift.com/introduction/gitops-multicluster/) — This course will guide you through the deployment of a simple application to multiple clusters, customize the application by cluster and perform a canary deployment, all of this using GitOps with OpenShift.

### Demo
If there is a simple way to set up an environment to demonstrate the thing,
discuss that fact in this section, and then describe the relevant next steps.
For example, where to find it in the demo system, or to look in the source
code repository (detailed in the source section) for more details.

### Workshop
If there is a workshop that covers this specific thing, link to the
workshop's documentation in this demo guide in this section.
