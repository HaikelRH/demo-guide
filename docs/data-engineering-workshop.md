This workshop is designed to show data engineers and system administrators
how to architect a data infrastructure service using the Open Data Hub. Our
goal is for engineers who are interested in developing platforms for the ML
and Analytics needs to walk away having learned data wrangling in a Hybrid
Cloud environment with Spark and JupyterHub.

Unlike some other workshops, the entirety of the activity is conducted within
JupyterHub.
