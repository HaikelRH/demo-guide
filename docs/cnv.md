Container-native virtualization lets developers bring virtual machines (VMs)
into containerized workflows by running a virtual machine within a container.
By combining these two technologies into a single management platform,
organizations take advantage of the simplicity and speed of containers and
Kubernetes while still benefiting from the applications and services that
have been architected for virtual machines.
